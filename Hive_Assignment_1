 1. Download vechile sales data -> https://github.com/shashank-mishra219/Hive-Class/blob/main/sales_order_data.csv

2. Store raw data into hdfs location

    hadoop fs -mkdir /tmp/dirx
    hadoop fs -put /home/cloudera/poonam/sales_order_data.csv /tmp/dirx
    
    
3. Create a internal hive table "sales_order_csv" which will store csv data sales_order_csv .. make sure to skip header row while creating table
   create table sales_order_data_csv_v1
(
ORDERNUMBER int,
QUANTITYORDERED int,
PRICEEACH float,
ORDERLINENUMBER int,
SALES float,
STATUS string,
QTR_ID int,
MONTH_ID int,
YEAR_ID int,
PRODUCTLINE string,
MSRP int,
PRODUCTCODE string,
PHONE string,
CITY string,
STATE string,
POSTALCODE string,
COUNTRY string,
TERRITORY string,
CONTACTLASTNAME string,
CONTACTFIRSTNAME string,
DEALSIZE string
)
row format delimited
fields terminated by ','
tblproperties("skip.header.line.count"="1")
; 


4. Load data from hdfs path into "sales_order_csv" 


     load data inpath  /tmp/dirx  into table sales_order_data_csv_v1
     
     
5. Create an internal hive table which will store data in ORC format "sales_order_orc"

      create table sales_order_data_orc_v1
(
ORDERNUMBER int,
QUANTITYORDERED int,
PRICEEACH float,
ORDERLINENUMBER int,
SALES float,
STATUS string,
QTR_ID int,
MONTH_ID int,
YEAR_ID int,
PRODUCTLINE string,
MSRP int,
PRODUCTCODE string,
PHONE string,
CITY string,
STATE string,
POSTALCODE string,
COUNTRY string,
TERRITORY string,
CONTACTLASTNAME string,
CONTACTFIRSTNAME string,
DEALSIZE string
)
row format delimited
fields terminated by ','
stored as orc ;

6. Load data from "sales_order_csv" into "sales_order_orc"

 from sales_order_data_csv_v1 insert overwrite table sales_order_data_orc_v1 select *;

Perform below menioned queries on "sales_order_orc" table :

a. Calculatye total sales per year

    select sum(sales) as total_sales , year_id from sales_order_data_orc_v1 group by year_id;
    
    
b. Find a product for which maximum orders were placed
      select QUANTITYORDERED 
      from sales_order_data_desc 
      order by QUANTITYORDERED desc 
      limit 1
      
      
c. Calculate the total sales for each quarter
 
    select sum(sales) as total_sales, QTR_id 
    from sales_order_data_orc_v1
    group by QTR_ID ;

   
 
d. In which quarter sales was minimum

e. In which country sales was maximum and in which country sales was minimum
f. Calculate quartelry sales for each city
h. Find a month for each year in which maximum number of quantities were sold
